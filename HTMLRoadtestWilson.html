<h1> Monica Wilson HTML Roadtest</h1>
<p> I will be completely honest, this is my second time using this program and it still absolutely terrifies me. 
    <br> I don't know if its the ADHD or the pretty colors and the letters that all look alarmingly "code-like" but my brain instantly freezes when I see these pages. 
   <br> I am hoping that I learn more throughout the semester. I know this will not be something that we dive too deeply into but for the sake of not failing IST 250, I'm hoping I get the hang of it.
   <br> In a weird way I try to see it as a puzzle because I love puzzles. There is an agreeable symmetry to coding which I am hoping to lean into and become less terrified by it. </p>
